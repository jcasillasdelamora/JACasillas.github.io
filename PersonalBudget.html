      <p class="speech">Keeping money is not being a strong suit for me over the majority of my life, after seeing how debt and money hemorrhaging have being a constant battle for me and my friends, I thought we put our collective computer science and accounting skills together to build a simple web app that can give it’s users an idea of how they can better manage their income in meaningful way in the hopes that they can gain a peace of mind on their finances and enjoy the fruits of their labor with a bit less guilt of over spending.  </p>

      <p class="speech">The approach to your budgeting in this app is very simple, we take your income, subtract your expenses from that income and furthermore plan what you want to do with the rest, you can set up a goal that you want to achieve and see how much money you have to ether save or have a little guilty free pleasure. This is just a base line model which will give you a ball park idea of how to save and pend your money, it doesn’t take into account unexpected expenses, but like counting calories and losing weight, your budgeting success will depend on your ability to commit to some restraint in spending habits. </p>
